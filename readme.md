# Challenge!

# Considerations

To avoid possible runtime compatibility issues please make sure to use Java 11 or greater. 


# Setup & Execute

1. clone repository with ```git clone https://github.com/rarg22/jobsity-challenge```

2. Build the project with ```mvn package``` . This will run all relevant tests and if succesful create the .jar executable.

3. Finally, run the executable by using ```java -jar ./target/challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --ftr="./src/main/resources/sample_input_1.txt"```. In this case I've decided to execute the sample file.



# Observations

I've included a couple of test files under "src/main/resources" that can be used to test the application against different input files.
